# Sample Application using Google App Engine

This is a sample application I'm writing to learn how to write a Google App Engine web application that the Android client can connect to and receive/send data.

## Requirements

- Google App Engine Python SDK
- Python v2.7
- Google Account (For project creation and restricted methods in backend)
